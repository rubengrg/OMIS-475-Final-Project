    <h3>I am considering joining Sigma Alpha Mu, What can I expect candidacy to be like?</h3>
    
    
   <p>Instantly, you will find yourself meeting a whole new social circle which will put you in contact with various student leaders, community members, and chapter alumni. While attending recruitment events does not obligate you in any way to join, we hope that they will offer you a good opportunity to meet the active members of our chapter, and more importantly give them an opportunity to meet you. However, rather than pressuring you or trying to sell you on past accomplishments, we stress the importance of feeling comfortable and “fitting in” with our members while still promoting a strong sense of individualism.The next step will inolve joining our candidate education process. This probationary period lasts around 8 weeks and will prepare you for being an active member of the chapter. While only a few weeks long, our process is education intensive- Fraternity and chapter history as well as standards and expectations of membership will be introduced to members throughout our cadidate classes. Candidates will be expected to attend and actively participate in their candidacy and educative process before being asked to join our active membership. Presuming all educational, academic, and financial obligations have been satisfactorily met within your 8 week candidacy period, you will be asked to join the brotherhood afforded to active members of the chapter.
