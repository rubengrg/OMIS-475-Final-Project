    <p>In the fall of 1909, the sophomore class at the College of the City of New York had found itself embarrassed by "lowly freshmen". At a school where "warfare" between freshman and sophomore class was a tradition, the sophomores found it necessary to regain their fallen honor. Class Marshal Lester Cohen called a meeting of sophomore leaders on November 26, 1909, to decide on a plan for redemption. Eight appeared- Cohen, Hyman Jacobson, Adolph I. Fabis, Samuel Ginsburg, Abram N. Kerner, Jacob Kaplan, Ira N. Lind, and David D. Levinson, who is now known as the Founders of Sigma Alpha Mu.
        They believed in fraternalism among Jewish college men, convinced that without it, a large number of Jewish students would be deprived of the pleasant associations and companionships they now find in most colleges.<br><br>
        Sigma Alpha Mu has always acknowledged with a deep appreciation of its Jewish heritage and the ethical values of Judaism which have enriched its life and the lives of its members.
    <br><p>With the advent of the mid-twentieth century, expressions of liberalism suggested that constitutional limitations of membership to any particular religious group were not in keeping with the ideals of democracy which had always been part of the Fraternity's creed. Thus, responsive to this thinking, Sigma Alpha Mu at its 1953 Convention amended its constitution, making eligible for membership any male student of good moral character who respects the ideals and traditions of the Fraternity.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the 1980 spring semester, the expansion team at Sigma Alpha Mu International Fraternity decided that Northern Illinois University would be an excellent selection for an expansion effort. Situated within about an hour from existing chapters in Iowa and Chicago, The future location of Gamma Lambda was made attractive to SAM Field Rep Ronn Tulman. He set out on finding the right group of men to start the chapter. By choosing names practically at random from a phone book, Ronn found that several men were actually quite interested in hearing about the opportunity ΣΑΜ offered. Excited about the positive response, Ronn quickly organized a meeting to discuss the possibility of a ΣΑΜ colony at NIU.
    While several options were considered, eventually the members decided on a property just off campus. While considered the “Old Greek Row” neighborhood, 230 Augusta Ave was chosen for its size, proximity to campus, and because of its affordability. Nearly twenty members moved into the house in its first year. With membership growing, a strong group of good friends, and an adequate housing facility the chapter continued to grow.<br><br>
